	<h1>Event Rentals + Wedding Tent Rentals in Peterborough</h1>
	<p> Planning a Peterborough wedding, birthday, retirement or anniversary celebration? How about a fundraising gala, a blood drive, company picnic or community event? Trade show? Fashion show? Dog show? Whatever your special event, Gervais Rentals has all of the event rental equipment you need to make it amazing.</p>

	<p><strong>Tent Rentals</strong></p>
	<p>Tent rentals are one of our specialties, and are popular for customers who want to host outdoor events or dining while still maintaining protection from the elements. We offer tents of all sizes as well as tent accessories (think flooring and dance floors, wall panels, fans, partitions and more). We also have tent rental packages to help simplify your experience and budgeting.</p>
	
	<p><strong>Event Furniture</strong></p>
	<p>From bridal showers to corporate meet and greets, we have rental furniture to help equip your space for virtually any need. This includes various styles of tables and chairs, as well as lounge and bar furniture, as well as table accessories such as linens, centrepieces, place settings and more. </p>

	<p><strong>Party Supply Rental</strong></p>
	<p>Once you have your foundation set, then we get to the fun stuff. Want to roll out the red carpet or separate your VIPs behind velvet rope? We can rent you those. Want to put on a show with a raised stage, ramp, and on-stage audience? We’ve got you. How about a casino night? A lemonade stand? Old-timey popcorn maker? Check, check and check. </p>

	<p><strong>Wedding Rentals</strong></p>
	<p>Weddings are the ultimate event, and our Peterborough event rental customers tend to have an especially clear vision for what they want their special day to look like. From tents and tables and place settings to dance floors, catering equipment and bar setup — even sophisticated lounge seating for cocktail hour. We’ve supported thousands of Peterborough weddings with our rental equipment and supplies. It would be our honour to supply yours. </p>
