	<p><strong>The Gervais Difference</strong></p>

	<p>We’ve been in business for plenty of years, and we’ve learned a few things along the way - including how important great customer service is. When you choose our team you can be confident that you’re receiving the best care possible. From your first meet with us to our final pickup at your event location, you can expect helpful service with a smile. Best yet, we offer set-up and tear-down services in addition to a 24/7 emergency line. If a disaster strikes five minutes before the event or the weather causes a change in plans, you won’t have to worry - our team will resolve the issue/setback ASAP, so you can focus on living it up on the dance floor (or impressing your work colleagues!).</p>

	<p>We’re the wedding rental and event rental provider of choice in Clarington for a reason. Speak with one of our team members today to start planning your party.</p>
