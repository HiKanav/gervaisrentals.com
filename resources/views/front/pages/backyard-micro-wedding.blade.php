		<strong>Unparalleled Wedding Rental Inventory</strong>
	</p>
	<p>
		A backyard is a lovely setting for a micro wedding. But it does bring with it some specific logistical needs. Fortunately, we have a wide selection of equipment and supplies — and decades of experience — available right here in Toronto.
	</p>
	<p>
		Tents, chairs, and dance floors are among the mainstays of backyard wedding rentals, but we have rentals to cover virtually every other aspect of your outdoor ceremony and/or reception as well. Whether it&#39;s a large estate affair or an intimate micro wedding, rental equipment can provide the backdrop to celebrations of any size and style.
	</p>
	<p>
		From the moment you walk down the aisle, until your aunt shuts down the dance floor. Photo ops, cocktail hour, cake-cutting, and wacky family traditions. From a formal elegant sit-down reception, to modern lounge seating, to rustic charm. Whatever your vision: we&#39;ve got you.
	</p>
	<p>
		Our selection of over<a href="https://gervaisrentals.com/rentals"> 1,200 high-quality party rental items</a>&nbsp;is guaranteed to have any and everything you need to make your backyard wedding an event to remember — and to make it yours.
