	<p>
		Weddings are a big deal. Unless you’re a professional party planner, it’s probably the biggest event that you will ever have to plan. And that can feel intimidating.
	</p>

	<p>
		At Gervais Party & Tent Rentals, we’re more than willing to streamline the process for you. One of our team members will guide you through your options, make sure you tick-off all those must-have items, and <a href="https://www.gervaisrentals.com/wedding-rentals" target="_blank"> help you create the wedding space </a>you’ve always dreamed of. Your dream wedding is within easy reach!

			Tent Rentals
		</strong>
	</p>

	<p>
		Plenty of event visions include a beautiful nature-themed backdrop: rolling hills, views of the lake, grand old trees. The issue? By staging your event outdoors, you’re leaving it at the mercy of the elements. 
	</p>
	<p>
		A solidly erected tent can help remedy that issue. At Gervais Party & Tent Rentals we have a <a href="https://www.gervaisrentals.com/tent-packages.htm" target="_blank"> variety of options </a> for you to choose from, from small cabana-style tents to huge marquees with windowed walls. You can have peace of mind about your big day without sacrificing your event vision.
