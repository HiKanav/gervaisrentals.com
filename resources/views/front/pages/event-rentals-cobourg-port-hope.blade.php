	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>We’re a One Stop Event Shop</strong>
	</p>
	<p>
		As event rental specialists, our job is to equip you with everything you need to bring your dream event out of your dreams and into reality. This includes renting everything from <a href="https://www.gervaisrentals.com/tents-and-accessories.htm">tents</a>, portable dance floors and furniture to linens, lighting, audio and decor. We’ve got functional. We’ve got fun. We’ve got photo opps. We’ve got you!
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>We’re Tent Experts</strong>
	</p>
	<p>
		Come on, it’s in our name: Gervais Party and Tent Rentals has been in the tent rental business since the beginning of time (which for us started in 1949)! We have a variety of tent styles, configurations and <a href="https://www.gervaisrentals.com/rentals">accessories</a> to support virtually any tent rental need. From small, private gatherings to major public events, we have the tent (or tents!) for the job. And perhaps most importantly, we have decades of knowledge, experience and expertise to guide you through the process and identify the most appropriate equipment for your needs.
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>We’re Party People</strong>
	</p>
	<p>
		Once you’ve got the tent, then the fun begins. We can supply our Cobourg and Port Hope customers with just about anything you need inside the tent to make your party happen. Dance floor? Photo booth? Chocolate fountain? Check, check, check. Tables and chairs, linens, table settings, lighting, A/V equipment? Less exciting, but of course. The list goes on (and on and on!) - if you need it, we probably have it. And the advantage of working with Gervais Rentals is that if you’re not sure what you need (and what you don’t) we can guide you through the process to help match your party to your dreams and your budget.

		<strong>We Win at Weddings</strong>
	</p>
	<p>
		Just kidding. Your wedding is about you. But we’re here, behind the scenes, to help provide the perfect setting and backdrop for your special day to unfold. From chairs and decor for a ceremony, to tables and table settings for a dinner, to a dance floor and party lights for a late night boogie, our <a href="https://www.gervaisrentals.com/wedding-rentals">wedding rental offerings</a> are robust. We happily work with wedding planners or directly with the hosts. And we have a 24-hour emergency support line, so if you have a question, hit a snag, or need to add something last minute, we’ll be there for you.
