	<h1>Event Rentals, Tent Rentals + Wedding Rentals Scarborough</h1>
	<p>Whether you’re hosting something small or large in Scarborough, we know you want to create an event space that guests can enjoy and that you can feel proud of. Paper plates and get-togethers in the house basement just don’t cut it when it comes to celebrating many of life’s special moments. You want something that really wows people!</p>

	<p>At Gervais Rentals, we offer a wide variety of items that let you bring your event vision to life. You can trade the paper plates for beautiful china and the basement for a large white tent strung with string lights. We’ll make sure you have everything you need to create a seamless experience for your guests.</p>
