			Tent Packages
		</strong>
	</p>

	<p>
		Outdoor events are spectacular, but they come with one major downfall. They often leave you at the mercy of the elements.
	</p>

	<p>
		That’s where our tent packages come in. They’ll provide you with some much-needed coverage on the big day, so you can focus on celebrating and enjoying yourself (and stop eyeballing every dark cloud in the distance). We have tents in a wide variety of configurations, sizes, and styles, so there’s something for everyone and every event.

		<strong>
			Providing You With Peace of Mind
		</strong>	
	</p>
	<p>
		When it comes to your big day - whatever that may be - the stakes are high. You’ve spent a lot of time and money bringing your vision to life, and you want it to go off without a hitch. We help you in that endeavor by:

					<strong>
						Connecting You With the Right People
					</strong>
				</p>
				<p>
					We’ve met plenty of people in the event industry. If you need help choosing a venue, caterer, or party planner, we’d be more than happy to introduce you to people we trust.

					<strong>
						Offering Set-Up and Tear-Down Services
					</strong>
				</p>
				<p>
					You don’t want to worry about putting linens on chairs and erecting tents on the big day. That’s why we offer our set-up and tear-down services: we’ll bring the rentals to you, assemble everything together, and come back to pick it all up once the festivities have concluded.

					<strong>	
						Providing a 24/7 Emergency Line	
					</strong>	
				</p>	
				<p>	
					Even the best-laid plans can be derailed. In the event that you get some unexpected guests, rain starts to pour on your outdoor wedding, or you forget to order chairs (it happens!), you can take comfort inknowing help is just a call away. One of our team members will gladly come help.
