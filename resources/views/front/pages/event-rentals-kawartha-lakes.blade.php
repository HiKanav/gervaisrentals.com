		<strong>Tent Rentals</strong>

		Let&rsquo;s start with tents, which are key to keeping the sun off your chocolate sculpture and the rain off your parade (maybe even literally - our biggest tent holds 900 people).

	<p>
		<a href="/tents-and-accessories.htm">Tent rentals​</a> are our most popular rental product, and we have as wide a range of sizes and options as our customers have guest lists and decor themes.

We&rsquo;ve been doing this since 1949 and can guide you to the best fit for your event. If you are hosting guests in an outdoor setting, we&rsquo;ve got you covered - literally.
	</p>
	<p>
		Ask about our ​<a href="/tent-packages.htm">Tent Packages​</a> , which make things even simpler by bundling tent, tables, chairs, tent sides, lighting, dance floor, and inspection/installation. Boom. Done.
