	<h1>Event Rentals + Wedding Tent Rentals in Muskoka</h1>
	<p> Ready to throw an event the likes of which Muskoka has never seen? Get in touch with the team at Gervais Party and Tent Rentals for the event equipment befitting a day to last a lifetime. We’ve done weddings and commitment ceremonies. Birthday parties and bar mitzvahs. Corporate events and community fundraisers. We have the experience, the inventory, and the team to help set the stage: all you need to do is shine.</p>

	<p><strong>Wedding Rentals For Your Big Day</strong></p>
	<p> Wedding rentals are one of our most popular offerings among our Muskoka customers. As a company that’s been in the event business since 1949, we’ve provided rentals for hundreds and hundreds of local weddings over the years. Each is special, and each deserves proper equipment and rental supplies to help guests – and especially the special couple – focus on enjoying their special time together in comfort and ease. </p>

	<p>Wedding rental supplies we are proud to offer include:</p>

	<p>We also provide delivery, setup, and 24/7 support in case you have day-of questions. And if you change your mind and need to add something at the last minute (hey, it happens!), we’ll do everything we can to accommodate your request.</p>

	<p><strong>Muskoka Event Rentals</strong></p>
	<p>Weddings are one of the most common event types for large-scale rental needs. But plenty of other events are made possible (and made easier!) with supplies from Gervais. We have an inventory of over 1,200 high quality event rentals, from large scale structural pieces (tents, flooring, furniture) to the smaller details (dishware and catering supplies). </p>

	<p>Event rentals are what help you turn your event into an experience. With the right setup, you can transform an empty tent into a place where memories are made. We even have rentals to help with the main event if you’re hosting a performance or speaker – think staging, red carpet, podium, etc.</p>

	<p><strong>The Best Staff</strong></p>
	<p>We think so – but more importantly, our customers have raved as well. Our staff know our inventory. 1,200 is a big catalog, but they know the ins and outs of different party rentals and what works best for different uses. </p>

	<p>They’re also helpful. Customer service is the foundation of our business, so whether it’s walking you through what you need (and don’t!) for the size and scope of your event, showing up early for delivery and set-up, or visiting your event on-site after hours to help troubleshoot, our team goes above and beyond to help your event become a reality.</p>
