	<h1>Event Rentals + Wedding Tent Rentals in Uxbridge</h1>
	<p> Party time in Uxbridge? Time to call Gervais Party and Tent Rentals. Our expertise is right there in our name, so you know this is our thing. Since 1949 we’ve been helping make the magic happen, equipping party and event hosts with everything they need to turn a regular day into an awesome memory.</p>

	<p> From our wide range of tents and furniture, to our catalog of 1,200+ items from lighting to niche decor, you could say that we have the cake and the icing. (To be clear: we’re not actually a bakery. But we’ve worked with some good ones.)</p>

	<p><strong>Tent Rentals</strong></p>
	<p>Tents are, well, the tentpole of keeping outdoor events comfortable. We have all sizes and styles of tents for renting in Uxbridge and the surrounding area, to accommodate everything from a small popup at a community event or a large drive-through clinic. We have tent accessories such as flooring and paneling, and our experts can do setup and tear down.</p>
	
	<p>We’ve even created tent packages to help you bundle exactly what you need for a clear, straightforward, all-in-one price.</p>

	<p><strong>Wedding Rentals</strong></p>
	<p>Big day, little details. From ceremony to cocktail hour to dinner to dancing the night away, whatever the agenda for your special day, we probably have the stuff  you need to make it happen. Chairs and tables, flower stands, portable dance floors, table settings, serving equipment, lighting, lounge furniture, photo op decor - the list goes on and on and on. </p>

	<p>Our wedding rental services are among the most popular events we support (especially in the summer, for obvious reasons!) and we have the experience and expertise to help you identify exactly which wedding supply rentals make the most sense for the wedding you (or your planner) have in mind!</p>

	<p><strong>Party & Event Rentals</strong></p>
	<p>Community event? Family gathering? Graduation? Milestone birthday? Retirement? Cat’s milestone birthday or retirement? We’re not here to judge — we’re here to help you make it happen. </p>
