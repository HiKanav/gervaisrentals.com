			One-on-one assistance: While you can certainly take it upon yourself to browse through our 1,200 + rentals and order a few needed items, we recommend planning things out with one of our representatives. They’ll do the hunting for you, providing you with suggestions that fit your theme and budget.

			Set-up and tear-down services: You’ve got a lot on your plate. Erecting a tent shouldn’t be one of them. Just let us know your event venue and date and we’ll take care of the rest, assembling everything together for you. And once the festivities have concluded, we’ll happily come back to pick everything up.
