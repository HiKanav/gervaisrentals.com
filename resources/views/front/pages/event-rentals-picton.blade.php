	<h1>Event Rentals + Wedding Tent Rentals in Picton</h1>
	<p> Calling all party planners, event organizers and celebration hosts in Picton! Would a one stop rental shop for tents and party supplies help you out? An inventory of over 1,200 high quality event rental supplies? How about experienced staff who have supported virtually every event type under the sun and thrive on awesome customer service?</p>

	<p> You’ve come to the right place. As you can tell from our name, Gervais Party & Tent Rentals is a business built on supplying our customers with the supplies and equipment they need to turn that empty backyard, gymnasium, parking lot or conference center into the wedding of your dreams, the corporate event of the year, or the birthday party of the decade. </p>

	<p>Since 1949, we’ve been helping the good people of Picton create the events of their dreams with our extensive inventory and customer focused approach. In that time, we have truly seen it all. From the smallest, most private gatherings, to a festival for the whole town, we love to support it all.</p>

	<p>Here’s a bit more about what we offer in a few of our most popular categories.</p>

	<p><strong>Wedding Rentals in Picton</strong></p>
	<p>Weddings! They’re some of the most memorable and meaningful events we attend in our lives. And we all know, they’re also a lot of work to pull off behind the scenes.</p>
	
	<p>This is where Gervais’ focus on customer service really makes a difference. Most people who are planning a wedding haven’t gone through it before and have a lot of questions about what they need. We can talk you through the options, and help you find the best options for your theme, dreams and budget.</p>

	<p><strong>Event Rentals in Picton</strong></p>
	<p>When we say “one stop shop,” we’re not exaggerating. Since 1949 we have been supporting events of all kinds throughout Toronto, GTA and all of Southern Ontario. In that time, we’ve gained a huge amount of knowledge about putting on a great event. (Don’t worry, none of our supplies today have been around since 1949! Our inventory is completely modern. But we’ve kept the knowledge ‘in the family’ over the years, always building to offer more and better customer experiences over time.) </p>

	<p>Our event rentals offer everything you need, including:</p>
