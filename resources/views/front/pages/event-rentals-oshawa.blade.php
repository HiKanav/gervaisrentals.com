Our inventory has modernized a lot since then, but the heart of our business remains true: helping our customers throw awesome events by supplying the right rentals to make the magic happen!</p>

    <p><strong>Wedding Rentals</strong></p>
    <p>Are you hosting a wedding in or near Oshawa? You’ve come to the right place. Wedding rentals are our most popular rental category—and for good reason. Whether you’re transforming a family member’s backyard for a small intimate ceremony or throwing a big blow-out in a reception hall, weddings are an opportunity to create your dream environment for one the most special days of your life. </p>

    <p>Our wedding rentals include everything you need to make your wedding dream a reality. Tents? Check. Dance floor? Check. Furniture of all kinds? Check. Extensive dishware, serving equipment, linens and more? Check check check and check.</p>

    <p>Our inventory includes over <a href="https://gervaisrentals.com/rentals">1,200 unique event supplies</a>, so no matter the size, location or style of your wedding, chances are, we have the gear you need to get the job done. We also offer <a href="https://gervaisrentals.com/tent-packages.htm">wedding tent rental packages</a> to make your process even simpler. </p>

    <p>Gervais is happy to work directly with the couple or a family member if you’re doing the planning yourself, or with professional wedding or event planners if you’re bringing in hired support. We get along with everyone and enjoy what we do, so reach out and we’d be happy to help!</p>

    <p><strong>Event Rentals</strong></p>

    <p>Weddings aren’t the only events that deserve some shelter overhead and some quality seating below! Our inventory of 1,200 event supplies is available to support everything from birthdays and anniversaries to community events and vaccination clinics</p>

    <p>Tents are especially popular for Oshawa event rentals. We have a wide range of tent sizes and styles to support the logistical needs of your event. We also offer tent accessories (think tent flooring, wall panels, and more). Our tent rental packages include everything you need in one flat rate. And our tent installation and tear down services make it easy for you. We’ll handle the tent, you handle the event that happens inside of it. </p>

    <p>RIght up there with tent rentals are furniture rentals, especially tables and chairs. Again, we have a wide inventory of styles to support sit down banquets, standing cocktail hour, and everything in between.</p>

    <p>Since 1949, we’ve helped hosts in Oshawa and beyond hold successful events, and we’re here to help you, too. Give us a call to let us know what you’re planning and what you need. And if you don’t know what you need, that’s okay too! We’ve seen an event or two in our 70+ years and are happy to help guide you and answer any questions you have. </p>
