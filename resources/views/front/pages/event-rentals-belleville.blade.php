	<h1>Event Rentals + Wedding Tent Rentals in Belleville</h1>
	<p> Ready to throw the event of the year? Event of the month will do, too. Whether you’re hosting a major milestone or a small but significant get together, Gervais Party and Tent Rentals is your trusted source for event, tent and wedding rentals in Belleville. Since 1949, we’ve helped power some pretty incredible weddings, birthday parties and special events.</p>

	<p> Our favourite thing about our work is helping our customers ensure they have everything to make their special day go smoothly. (Our second favourite thing is when we get to eat an extra slice of cake!)</p>

	<p> As a Belleville event rental supplier for over 70 years, two of our most popular offerings are tent rentals and wedding rentals.</p>

	<p><a href="https://gervaisrentals.com/tents-and-accessories.htm"><strong>Tent Rentals in Belleville</strong></a></p>
	<p>Tent rentals ensure adequate coverage and protection from the elements, as well as providing structure and flow for outdoor events. Our selection ranges from small pop-up tents to massive drive-through tents and everything in between.</p>
	
	<p>Looking for open-air sides, or side paneling? What about tent flooring (or a portable dance floor)? How about set-up / tear down service from seasoned pros, and a 24/7 support line for questions and assistance?</p>

	<p>When you think of an “event you will never forget with memories to last a lifetime,” odds are, a wedding will come to mind pretty quickly. Wedding rentals are our most popular event type, and for good reason. It’s not often you’ll bring together family and friends from all walks of life. It’s our honour and pleasure to provide wedding rental supplies ranging from tents and furniture to linens and place settings. </p>

	<p>Our most popular wedding rental categories include:</p>

	<p><a href="https://gervaisrentals.com/rentals"><strong>1,200 Rental Party and Event Supplies</strong></a></p>
	<p>Our catalog of party rentals is the most extensive you’ll find and is built on 70+ years of curating, updating and expanding our collection — ensuring that we can be your one stop shop for rental party supplies.</p>

	<p>Party rental supplies follow similar trends to weddings (tents, tables, chairs and dishes are among the most popular event rentals in Belleville). Our entire inventory complements the ‘must haves’ with some pretty niche offerings — from podiums and red carpets to casino equipment and dramatic decorative bird cages.</p>

	<p><strong>All-Inclusive Service and 24/7 Support</strong></p>
	<p>When you rent your party equipment from Gervais, you’re not just getting access to the supplies you need. You’re getting support of a community-focused business who puts our customers first. We work with you (or your event planner) to coordinate a specific delivery time for your supplies. We are happy to stay and set everything up, and get all of the furniture and equipment arranged just so. We will come back at the appointed time to pack and remove everything for you. And if you have any questions at any time, even in the middle of your event, we’re just a phone call away!</p>

	<p>As a proud local business, Gervais Party and Tent Rentals would be honoured to supply your Belleville event rental needs to make your next event a memorable reality!</p>
