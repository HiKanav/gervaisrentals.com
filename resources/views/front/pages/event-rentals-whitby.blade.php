    <h1>Event Rentals + Wedding Rentals in Whitby</h1>
    <p> Calling all Whitby event planners! You have the vision. Do you have the supplies and equipment? As a proud purveyor of wedding and event rentals, Gervais is Whitby’s trusted source for over <a href="https://gervaisrentals.com/rentals">1200+ different rental items</a>. And we promise you — you won’t find anyone as passionate as we are about helping customers throw an incredible party (or respectable business event) (or anything in between). </p>

    <p>The event rental process is simple. You can check out our online inventory listings to get a sneak peek, or just give us a call. Our experienced staff will take it from there.</p>

    <p><strong>High Quality Event Rental Inventory: 1200+ Options Strong</strong></p>
    <p>Know exactly what you need? Awesome. Not a clue? Not a worry. We’ve been in business since 1949, and have built our business around the needs and hottest trends along the way. Just tell our staff about your event — What’s the occasion? Location? Attendee count? What will the activities be? From there, we can guide you through selecting exactly what you need (and just as importantly, what you don’t) to make your event come to life.</p>

    <p><strong>Beautiful Wedding Rentals for your Special Day</strong></p>
    
    <p>Weddings are one of the most popular rental events, and for good reason. It’s a special day with memories to last a lifetime. Whether you are a professional wedding planner or planning on behalf of yourself or a loved one, we would be honoured to work with you to meet your <a href="https://gervaisrentals.com/wedding-rentals">wedding rental</a> needs. </p>

    <p>Among the most popular wedding rentals we provide are:</p>

    <ul style="margin-left: 40px;">

    <p><strong>Event Rentals To Suit Every Need</strong></p>

    <p>Weddings tend to get the most attention, but event rentals can meet a lot more needs. Birthday and anniversary parties. Graduations, retirements, bridal and baby showers. Church and community events. Fundraisers and charity galas. Marathons and fun runs. Political rallies. Vaccination sites. Fairs. Festivals. The list goes on.</p>

    <p>How many different types of events do you think have been hosted in Ontario since 1949? Yeah, we can’t count either, but it’s safe to say we’ve supported just about everything you can imagine. These events all have at least one thing in common: they don’t take place in an empty lot! Whether indoor or outdoor, our event rentals augment whatever space you’re working with to turn it into exactly the experience you envision for your guests.</p>

    <p><strong>Customer Service That Counts</strong></p>
    <p>We’ve been in business as long as we have because we always put our customers first. From booking to set up to tear down, we want you to have as great of an experience with Gervais as your guests do with you! We are happy to answer any questions you have, and once you’ve booked, you can call our 24/7 support line for last minute requests and support. As a company known for our tent rentals especially, we promise you this: we’ve got you covered.</p>
