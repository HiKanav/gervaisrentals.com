	<p>Experience The Difference at Gervais</p>

	<p>While we pride ourselves on our vast collection of <a href="https://www.gervaisrentals.com/rentals">1,200+ rental items</a>, it’s our customer service that sets us apart. We know that it can be stressful planning an event, and we do our best to relieve the burden on our clients by offering complete packages, set-up and tear-down services, and a 24/7 emergency line.</p>

	<p>Complete Packages: Our representatives will make sure you get everything you need for the big day. We offer packages including tents, silverware, drinkware, tableware, and a whole host of other items. With us by your side, you won’t have to worry about forgetting something important: we’ll make sure you’re fully prepared and stress-free. Best yet? Our packages are budget-friendly.</p>

	<p>Set-Up and Tear Down Services: You should be focused on getting your hair and makeup done the morning of—not putting linens on tables and erecting a tent. Our team members will deliver the rental items to the specified venue, put everything together for you, and tear it all down once the party winds down. The result? You just have to worry about enjoying yourself on the dance floor (and maybe impressing the boss, if it’s a corporate event!).</p>

	<p>24/7 Emergency Line: Having a few extra guests (and not enough seating) may not qualify as a national disaster, but it certainly feels like one when you’re the party host. We’re happy to offer a 24/7 line for exactly that reason. If there’s a hiccup at your event, one of our team members will resolve it ASAP.</p>

	<p>For all your wedding, tent, and event rentals in Bowmanville, you can trust the knowledgeable and experienced team here at Gervais Party & Tent Rentals. We take pride in providing our clients with top-tier items and customer service. Give us a call today to start planning! </p>
